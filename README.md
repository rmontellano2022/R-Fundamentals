# D-Lab R Fundamentals Workshop Series  
This is the repository for D-Lab's introductory R-Fundamentals workshop series. Laptop, Internet connection, and Zoom account required.

# Workshop Goals 

There are four code files in this repository that we will walk through. The following topics will be covered:

**Part1.R** - Introduction to R, navigating RStudio, variable assignment, data types and coercion, data structures  
**Part2.R** - Import, subset, and merge data; identify missing data  
**Part3.R** - Research design, data summarization and visualization, statistical testing  
**Part4.R** - For-loops, custom functions, basic automation

# Installation Instructions

In preparation for the upcoming workshop you will need to install R and RStudio and the workshop materials.

1. Install R

Download R by clicking the link here: https://cloud.r-project.org/

Select your operating system and then click "base" (Windows users) or "R-4.0.3.pkg". Double-click this file once it has finished downloading and follow the instructions to install it.

2. Install RStudio

Download RStudio by visiting this link: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

Scroll down and click the Download button beneath "RStudio Desktop - Open Source License - Free". Double-click this file once it has finished downloading and follow the instructions to install it.

3. Download the workshop materials

Download the workshop materials by visiting the GitHub repository: https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/r-fundamentals

To download the repository, click the green button in the top right hand corner that says "Code" and then select "Download ZIP". You can then unzip the contents of the downloaded folder somewhere accessible on your local computer (we recommend your Desktop).

We will take a few minutes at the start of the workshop to make sure everyone has R and RStudio installed and the workshop materials downloaded. Please feel free to email dlab-frontdesk@berkeley.edu or visit our help desk at https://dlab.berkeley.edu/frontdesk if you have any questions.

If you are a Git user, simply clone this repository by opening a terminal and typing: “git clone https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/r-fundamentals.git”.

# Is R or RStudio not working on your laptop?

Attend the workshop anyway, we can provide you with a cloud-based solution (DataHub or Binder) until you figure out the problems with your local installation. 

If you have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can run these lessons on UC Berkeley's DataHub by clicking [this link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2Fpython-fundamentals&urlpath=tree%2Fpython-fundamentals%2F). By using this link, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go straight to DataHub (https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on the R-Fundamentals folder.
If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud, by clicking this [Binder button](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dlab-berkeley/python-fundamentals/master). By using this button, you cannot save your work unfortunately. 

**NOTE: D-Lab workshops normally start 10 minutes after the scheduled start time (“Berkeley Time”). We recommend you log on at the start time to join the waiting room where hosts will message you further information.**

# Start running the code!
**Open the file "Part1.R" to begin.** Place your cursor on a line of runnable code (lines without hashtags preceding them) and click the "Run" button or press Ctrl + Enter (PC) or command + Enter (Mac) to run a line of code. The output will appear in the "Console" section of RStudio. (MAY NEED TO UPDATE)

# About the UC Berkeley D-Lab
D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops such as R Fundamentals, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and programming languages.  

Visit the [D-Lab homepage](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/) to learn more about us. View our [calendar](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/calendar-node-field-date) for upcoming events, and also learn about how to utilize our [consulting](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting) and [data](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/data-resources) services.
